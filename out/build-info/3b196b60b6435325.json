This pattern implies two\n * things that go hand in hand:\n *\n * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\n * that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself.\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to\n * the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating\n * the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.\n *\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a\n * dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to\n * call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and\n * allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative\n * interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.\n *\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\n * inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\n * implementation.\n *\n * NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a\n * meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.\n *\n * IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an\n * immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be\n * overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an\n * undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin. Relying on the value of the admin slot\n * is generally fine if the implementation is trusted.\n *\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the\n * compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new\n * function and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This\n * could render the `upgradeToAndCall` function inaccessible, preventing upgradeability and compromising transparency.\n */\ncontract TransparentUpgradeableProxy is ERC1967Proxy {\n    // An immutable address for the admin to avoid unnecessary SLOADs before each call\n    // at the expense of removing the ability to change the admin once it's set.\n    // This is acceptable if the admin is always a ProxyAdmin instance or similar contract\n    // with its own ability to transfer the permissions to another account.\n    address private immutable _admin;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev The proxy caller is the current admin, and can't fallback to the proxy target.\n     */\n    error ProxyDeniedAdminAccess();\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Initializes an upgradeable proxy managed by an instance of a {ProxyAdmin} with an `initialOwner`,\n     * backed by the implementation at `_logic`, and optionally initialized with `_data` as explained in\n     * {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n     */\n    constructor(address _logic, address initialOwner, bytes memory _data) payable ERC1967Proxy(_logic, _data) {\n        _admin = address(new ProxyAdmin(initialOwner));\n        // Set the storage value and emit an event for ERC-1967 compatibility\n        ERC1967Utils.changeAdmin(_proxyAdmin());\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the admin of this proxy.\n     */\n    function _proxyAdmin() internal view virtual returns (address) {\n        return _admin;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev If caller is the admin process the call internally, otherwise transparently fallback to the proxy behavior.\n     */\n    function _fallback() internal virtual override {\n        if (msg.sender == _proxyAdmin()) {\n            if (msg.sig != ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.upgradeToAndCall.selector) {\n                revert ProxyDeniedAdminAccess();\n            } else {\n                _dispatchUpgradeToAndCall();\n            }\n        } else {\n            super._fallback();\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Upgrade the implementation of the proxy.

This contract extends\n * the ERC-20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \"shares\" token represented by this\n * contract and not the \"assets\" token which is an independent contract.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\n * with a \"donation\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation\n * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial\n * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may\n * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by\n * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as\n * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\n *\n * Since v4.9, this implementation introduces configurable virtual assets and shares to help developers mitigate that risk.\n * The `_decimalsOffset()` corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals\n * and the vault decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which\n * itself determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default\n * offset (0) makes it non-profitable even if an attacker is able to capture value from multiple user deposits, as a result\n * of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's donation) matching the attacker's expected gains.\n * With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more expensive than it is profitable. More details about the\n * underlying math can be found xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].\n *\n * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued\n * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets\n * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience\n * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the\n * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.\n *\n * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract ERC4626Upgradeable is Initializable, ERC20Upgradeable, IERC4626 {\n    using Math for uint256;\n\n    /// @custom:storage-location erc7201:openzeppelin.storage.ERC4626\n    struct ERC4626Storage {\n        IERC20 _asset;\n        uint8 _underlyingDecimals;\n    }\n\n    // keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256(\"openzeppelin.storage.ERC4626\")) - 1)) & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))\n    bytes32 private constant ERC4626StorageLocation = 0x0773e532dfede91f04b12a73d3d2acd361424f41f76b4fb79f090161e36b4e00;\n\n    function _getERC4626Storage() private pure returns (ERC4626Storage storage $) {\n        assembly {\n            $.slot := ERC4626StorageLocation\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to deposit more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to mint more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxMint(address receiver, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to withdraw more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(address owner, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to redeem more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(address owner, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Set the underlying asset contract.

information about EVM compatible chains that can be used in scripts/tests.\n * For each chain, the chain's name, chain ID, and a default RPC URL are provided. Chains are\n * identified by their alias, which is the same as the alias in the `[rpc_endpoints]` section of\n * the `foundry.toml` file. For best UX, ensure the alias in the `foundry.toml` file match the\n * alias used in this contract, which can be found as the first argument to the\n * `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl` call in the `initializeStdChains` function.\n *\n * There are two main ways to use this contract:\n *   1. Set a chain with `setChain(string memory chainAlias, ChainData memory chain)` or\n *      `setChain(string memory chainAlias, Chain memory chain)`\n *   2. Get a chain with `getChain(string memory chainAlias)` or `getChain(uint256 chainId)`.\n *\n * The first time either of those are used, chains are initialized with the default set of RPC URLs.\n * This is done in `initializeStdChains`, which uses `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl`. Defaults are recorded in\n * `defaultRpcUrls`.\n *\n * The `setChain` function is straightforward, and it simply saves off the given chain data.\n *\n * The `getChain` methods use `getChainWithUpdatedRpcUrl` to return a chain. For example, let's say\n * we want to retrieve the RPC URL for `mainnet`:\n *   - If you have specified data with `setChain`, it will return that.\n *   - If you have configured a mainnet RPC URL in `foundry.toml`, it will return the URL, provided it\n *     is valid (e.g. a URL is specified, or an environment variable is given and exists).\n *   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the default data is returned.\n *\n * Summarizing the above, the prioritization hierarchy is `setChain` -> `foundry.toml` -> environment variable -> defaults.\n */\nabstract contract StdChains {\n    VmSafe private constant vm = VmSafe(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(\"hevm cheat code\")))));\n\n    bool private stdChainsInitialized;\n\n    struct ChainData {\n        string name;\n        uint256 chainId;\n        string rpcUrl;\n    }\n\n    struct Chain {\n        // The chain name.\n        string name;\n        // The chain's Chain ID.\n        uint256 chainId;\n        // The chain's alias.
